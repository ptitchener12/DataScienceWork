*Purpose*: Vectors can hold data of only one *type*. While this isn't a course on computer science, there are some type "gotchas" to look out for when doing data science. This exercise will help us get ahead of those issues.

*Reading*: [Types](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r library}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Objects vs Strings
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

__q1__ Describe what is wrong with the code below.

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Describe what went wrong here
## Set our airport
airport <- "BOS"

## Check our airport value
airport == "ATL"
```

**Observations**:

- ATL should be in quotes to define it as a character value instead of an undefined variable. 

# Casting
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Sometimes our data will not be in the form we want; in this case we may need to *cast* the data to another format.

- `as.integer(x)` converts to integer
- `as.numeric(x)` converts to real (floating point)
- `as.character(x)` converts to character (string)
- `as.logical(x)` converts to logical (boolean)

```{r q2-task}
v_string <- c("00", "45", "90")
v_integer <- NA_real_
