*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_\(metalworking\))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   thick = col_double(),
    ##   E_00 = col_double(),
    ##   mu_00 = col_double(),
    ##   E_45 = col_double(),
    ##   mu_45 = col_double(),
    ##   E_90 = col_double(),
    ##   mu_90 = col_double(),
    ##   alloy = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 8
    ##   thick  E_00 mu_00  E_45  mu_45  E_90 mu_90 alloy  
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>  
    ## 1 0.022 10600 0.321 10700  0.329 10500 0.31  al_24st
    ## 2 0.022 10600 0.323 10500  0.331 10700 0.323 al_24st
    ## 3 0.032 10400 0.329 10400  0.318 10300 0.322 al_24st
    ## 4 0.032 10300 0.319 10500  0.326 10400 0.33  al_24st
    ## 5 0.064 10500 0.323 10400  0.331 10400 0.327 al_24st
    ## 6 0.064 10700 0.328 10500  0.328 10500 0.32  al_24st
    ## 7 0.081 10000 0.315 10000  0.32   9900 0.314 al_24st
    ## 8 0.081 10100 0.312  9900  0.312 10000 0.316 al_24st
    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy\! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

**q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have
column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, mu`. Make sure the `angle`
variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value","angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = c(2,3,4,5,6,7),
    values_drop_na = TRUE,
    names_transform = list(angle = as.integer)
  ) %>% 
  filter(E>0 & mu>0)

df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 x 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    mu
    ##    <dbl> <chr>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ##  1 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.321
    ##  2 0.022 al_24st    45 10700 0.329
    ##  3 0.022 al_24st    90 10500 0.31 
    ##  4 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.323
    ##  5 0.022 al_24st    45 10500 0.331
    ##  6 0.022 al_24st    90 10700 0.323
    ##  7 0.032 al_24st     0 10400 0.329
    ##  8 0.032 al_24st    45 10400 0.318
    ##  9 0.032 al_24st    90 10300 0.322
    ## 10 0.032 al_24st     0 10300 0.319
    ## # ... with 16 more rows

Use the following tests to check your work.

              )
            )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
## Dimensions
assertthat::assert_that(all(dim(df_stang_long) == c(26, 5)))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r

            )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Very good!")
```

    ## [1] "Very good!"

# EDA

addition, add your own question that you’d like to answer about the
data.

``` r

#glimpse(df_stang_long)
#summary(df_stang_long)
df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 x 5

    ##  5 0.022 al_24st    45 10500 0.331
    ##  6 0.022 al_24st    90 10700 0.323
    ##  7 0.032 al_24st     0 10400 0.329
    ##  8 0.032 al_24st    45 10400 0.318
    ##  9 0.032 al_24st    90 10300 0.322
    ## 10 0.032 al_24st     0 10300 0.319
    ## # ... with 16 more rows

**Observations**:

  - Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
    No - there are other factors that change these properties and
    therefore the properties will fall within a range.
  - How many aluminum alloys were tested? How do you know? One -
    al\_24st. I looked at all of the entries.
  - What angles were tested? 0,45 and 90
  - What thicknesses were tested? 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, 0.081
  - How do the properties of E and mu vary with the test’s relation to
    the grain direction of the steel? (Rolling direction).
  - No; we see a variety of values for `E` and `mu`.
  - Just one alloy: al\_24st
  - Angles: 0, 45, 90 (degrees)
  - Thicknesses: 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, 0.081 (in)
  - I’m curious if the properties `E, mu` vary with thickness

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

**q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q1
above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would
you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
df_stang_long %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = angle, y = mu,group = angle))
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_PaulT_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(mu, E, color = as_factor(thick), shape = as.character(angle))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_PaulT_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = angle, y = mu, color = as_factor(thick)))
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_PaulT_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-3.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_stang_long %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = thick, y = E,group = thick))
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_PaulT_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

  - It seems like these values do not vary significantly by angle, but
    they do appear to have some differences based on thickness. The
    0.08" thick sample is noticablly different from the other samples,
    in that it has a lower elasticity and lower poison’s ratio.

**q4** Consider the following statement:

“A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(mu, E, color = as_factor(thick), shape = as.character(angle))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_PaulT_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

  - Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?

The graph both supports and contradicts the claim above. The 0.081"
thick sample is clearly different from the other samples. However, the
other samples do not show a correlation between thickness and
properties. The thinnest sample does have the highest values, but the
second thinnest sample has lower values than the third thinnest sample
and all of the values are somewhat jumbled together.

THere is more data that is not available about the experiment that would
be interesting to know here. Were all of the samples rolled from the
same thickness material? This might mean that the grain structure would
have been changed differently through the rolling process.
